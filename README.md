brush up on express + MongoDB

reference: https://bezkoder.com/node-express-mongodb-crud-rest-api/

I had deep understanding on express.js server system, but it has been a while and I am only a little familiar with MongoDB and not too proficient with it. In fact, I have downloaded the MongoDB Compass for the first time with this tutorial project. In the past, I worked with MongoDB without the visual support of Compass.

- After this, I plan to work on a MEVN full-stack web app. I'm already very comfortable with Vue.js framework and I plan to practice a full-stack with Vue.js and express.js. 
I also plan to make API calls from express.js server, aka web scrape from weather API and possibly the TTC API.
